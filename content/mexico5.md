Mexico, Day 29
==============

If you zoom in (click), you can see a horse above the third post from the left,
in the center of the image.  My first few days in Aguascalientes, this horse
shamelessly presented itself near the fence.  I'll take a picture another day,
I said.  I'm in a hurry, I said.  Then the horse disappeared for weeks.
Imagine my concern.  When it finally returned, it stayed far away from the
road.  This is the best I could manage without venturing into the pasture.  I
can't help but wonder what might have been.

I'm sitting in another Aeromexico commuter jet, just having walked onboard
from the tarmac.  When I first arrived, there was a beautiful sunset behind the
mountains on the horizon past the runway, but in my fluster I didn't photograph
it.  This time around all we get is a view of the dusty distance.

As compensation, here is another sunset.

I invited Grace's parents over to the Airbnb for dinner.  Here we are having a
dessert of pineapple and mango with chamoy and taj√≠n.  The main course was
again Grace's sun-dried tomato chicken and roasted potatoes, and my chicken
stew.  This time I put a little wine in the soup; I think it worked well.

Grace saved the street food for the end of the trip.  Last night we went
driving in search of "street corn," or "elote," or "chascas."  Because it was a
notable historical figure's birthday, and because it was Sunday, most of the
street corn vendors were closed.  But not this one.

I ordered... something.  It looks kind of like what I imagine the inside of an
animal looks like.

It's primarily corn, but there's also cheese and bacon and mushrooms and stuff
_there's so much stuff_.

As if that weren't enough (Grace got a smaller dish), we ordered tacos when we
got back home.

Tacos!

That's about it.  I checked my bag this time, because it now contains a cast
iron skillet (never leave a soldier behind) and a bottle of tequila.  Since you
were wondering, here's the accumulation of a month's worth of grocery
shopping.

I kept the skillet and the tequila glasses, but the rest is for the next guy.
Except the pepper.  Grace's mom got the pepper.

We in no way finished the puzzle.

Ahora, a Nueva York.
