<p>He didn't get left behind, after all.  It should have occurred to me earlier
to search for the marble elephant in a marble room.</p>

<p>Asha and Vineet are now married.  They were already married, but now they still
are.</p>
<p>Here was my view of the beginning of the ceremony:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_34_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>After a while, the staff began bringing in chairs, so by remaining standing I
got a better view of what was going on.  Asha and Vineet were sitting on a
bench opposite a small fire.  On the other side was a priest with a microphone.</p>

</video><p>This ritual likely had a deep significance for a few attending, but not for the
bride or groom.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_35_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>At Indian weddings, women have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna">henna</a> drawn on their bodies in a style
known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi">mehndi</a>.  Here is Asha the bride:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_17_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here is Asha the cat:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/asha3_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>The mehndi artist applies the henna as a paste, carefully decorating the skin
as a pastry chef would.</p>
<p>Immediately after, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_7_small.jpg" /></p>

<p>The women then are unable to use their hands for well over an hour.  It was
hilarious.</p>
<p>After drying and being scratched off onto a torn piece of newspaper, the
stained skin starts to gradually darken from a iodine orange to a deep red
brown.  Here's Andrea a day after:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_37_small.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_38_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>Speaking of Andrea, check her out.  She borrowed this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari">sari (saree)</a> from
the groom's mother.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_29_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was wearing my blue suit.  You've already seen it.  If you really want to
see more, then I refer you to any of the ten million photographers hired for
the wedding.</p>
<p>Oh, I just remembered the band that played during the first event.  They were
told to turn down on at least two separate occasions, but the Force was strong
with them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_21_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>Later that evening, a different band played Hotel California.  The guitar solo
was on point.  The vocals were better than I could do.</p>
<p>Here's what you can see from my room:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_2_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>and here's what you can see from the pool:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_22_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>and that's about all I shot.</p>

<p>Reading the complimentary Hindustan Times this morning over breakfast, I was
surprised to see no fewer than three rape-related articles.  Now, I know that
newspapers tend to focus on the morbid and sensational, and that 1.3 billion
people live in India, but still:</p>
<ul>
<li>"DCW to help in rehabilitating Unnao rape victim"</li>
<li>"Raj minor kills herself after gang rape"</li>
<li>"Man held for raping minor daughter"</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Q84">novel</a> I'm reading, a shelter for battered women and themes
involving abuse, rape, and incest feature prominently. I'm not sure what all
this is trying to tell me.</p>
<p>Here is a marble elephant.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../site/india4_24_small.jpg" /></p>
<p>At eight o'clock I'll be meeting a new friend for dinner and then getting up
rather early tomorrow for a flight to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala">Kerala</a>, where the second half of
this trip begins.
