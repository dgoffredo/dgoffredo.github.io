<p>If you zoom in (click), you can see a horse above the third post from the left,
in the center of the image.  My first few days in Aguascalientes, this horse
shamelessly presented itself near the fence.  I'll take a picture another day,
I said.  I'm in a hurry, I said.  Then the horse disappeared for weeks.
Imagine my concern.  When it finally returned, it stayed far away from the
road.  This is the best I could manage without venturing into the pasture.  I
can't help but wonder what might have been.</p>
<p>I'm sitting in another Aeromexico commuter jet, just having walked onboard
from the tarmac.  When I first arrived, there was a beautiful sunset behind the
mountains on the horizon past the runway, but in my fluster I didn't photograph
it.  This time around all we get is a view of the dusty distance.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_50.jpg"><img src="mexico_50_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>As compensation, here is another sunset.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_52.jpg"><img src="mexico_52_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>I invited Grace's parents over to the Airbnb for dinner.  Here we are having a
dessert of pineapple and mango with chamoy and taj√≠n.  The main course was
again Grace's sun-dried tomato chicken and roasted potatoes, and my chicken
stew.  This time I put a little wine in the soup; I think it worked well.</p>

<p><a href="mexico_54.jpg"><img src="mexico_54_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p><a href="mexico_55.jpg"><img src="mexico_55_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>Grace saved the street food for the end of the trip.  Last night we went
driving in search of "street corn," or "elote," or "chascas."  Because it was a
notable historical figure's birthday, and because it was Sunday, most of the
street corn vendors were closed.  But not this one.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_56.jpg"><img src="mexico_56_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>I ordered... something.  It looks kind of like what I imagine the inside of an
animal looks like.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_57.jpg"><img src="mexico_57_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>It's primarily corn, but there's also cheese and bacon and mushrooms and stuff
<em>there's so much stuff</em>.</p>
<p>As if that weren't enough (Grace got a smaller dish), we ordered tacos when we
got back home.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_58.jpg"><img src="mexico_58_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p><a href="mexico_59.jpg"><img src="mexico_59_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p><a href="mexico_60.jpg"><img src="mexico_60_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>Tacos!</p>
<p>That's about it.  I checked my bag this time, because it now contains a cast
iron skillet (never leave a soldier behind) and a bottle of tequila.  Since you
were wondering, here's the accumulation of a month's worth of grocery
shopping.</p>
<p><a href="mexico_61.jpg"><img src="mexico_61_small.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525"></img> </a></p>
<p>I kept the skillet and the tequila glasses, but the rest is for the next guy.
Except the pepper.  Grace's mom got the pepper.</p>
<p>We in no way finished the puzzle.</p>

<p>Ahora, a Nueva York.</p>
