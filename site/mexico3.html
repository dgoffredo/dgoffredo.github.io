<div class="table-of-contents"><ul><li><a href="#mexico_day_13">Mexico, Day 13</a></li></ul></div>

<h1 id="mexico_day_13">Mexico, Day 13</h1>
<p>It's laundry day again.  This time I included two bath towels, so now all of
my clothes are covered in white lint.</p>

<p>Aguascalientes doesn't fuck around with its sunsets.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Grace, her parents, and I visited the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvillo">Calvillo</a>.
Manuel drove us down from the stratosphere and across swaths of
characteristically Mexican landscape.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_21_small.jpg" alt="" /> </p>

<p>Calvillo has narrow streets lined with brightly colored buildings.  Some of
the streets (not pictured) were steeply inclined and reminded me of San
Francisco.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at a nice outdoor restaurant attached to a hillside hotel.</p>

<p>For a desert-dwelling Mexican, Grace does not much tolerate hot weather.  She
prefers a vampiric lifestyle.</p>
<p>I've been eating food, can you believe?</p>
<p>That morning I fried some leftover bacon for breakfast.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_28_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Previously, madre Graciela had prepared Manuel's favorite dish for us:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno">chile relleno</a>.  They are distantly related to the stuffed bell peppers
that my mom used to make, except fried with egg whites and filled with
minced meat.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_29_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Grace and I cooked a pasta/chicken/eggplant recipe of hers. There is still
some left over...</p>
<p><img src="mexico_30_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I improvised some chicken-with-leeks-over-pasta dish.  I got the wrong cut of
chicken from the supermarket, but it was edible nonetheless.  Grace had never
had leeks before.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_31_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I also cooked a big batch of my <a href="https://www.littlebroken.com/one-pot-chicken-stew/">chicken stew</a> last night, but I don't
have any pictures.</p>
<p>There's a tiny sorbet store of great renown near Grace's parents' place. She
got strawberry and I got tamarind.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_32_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The real culinary innovation of the trip so far is how to eat fruit.  In Mexico
there are two magical condiments that form a dyad of fruictific perfection:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamoy">chamoy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj%C3%ADn_(seasoning)">tajín</a>.  They balance the sweetness of fruit with tart,
salty, and savory goodness.  Grace's favorite is on mango.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_33_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here she is looking smug about her preparation of pineapple.</p>
<p><img src="mexico_34_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Speaking of food, it's one o'clock here and I haven't eaten today.  Let's put
that microwave to use.  ¡Adios!</p>
