</style><p>I'm making a beer for the first time since the end of 2017, so I thought I'd
blog about it.  This will be the first post in a "beer" series.</p>
<p>I brewed this batch on May 8, 2021.  Grace was here and helped out.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>I made a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_pale_ale">IPA</a> based on the ingredients I had on hand.  They're all <em>old</em>
ingredients, which might have been problematic, but I think I'll get a solid
beer out of it anyway.</p>

</table><h2 id="grain_preparation">Grain Preparation</h2>
<p>I used my bathroom scale to weigh out the bulk grains from the bags that had
been sitting in my refrigerator for five years.  At one point, my body weight
(which I was using as a zero for weighing the grains) showed a different value,
so that's why I suspect the ≈14 lbs. of 2-row might actually have been more.
That, or I got a much better mash/sparge efficiency than I've previously
measured.</p>
<p>I crushed the grain out back using my trusty modified <a href="https://victoriacookware.com/">Victoria</a> grain mill.</p>
<p><a href="mill.jpg"><img src="mill_small.jpg" alt="grain mill setup" height="933"></img></a></p>
<p>Instead of letting the crushed grain collect in a garbage bag, I cut the bag so
that it acts as a chute, and the grains fall into a plastic bucket below.  Much
better.  The grain generated a lot of dust, because it was so old and dry.</p>
<h2 id="mashing">Mashing</h2>
<p>I mashed thick, using ≈4 gallons of water for ≈16.5 pounds of grain (just less
than 1 qt./lb.).  I heated the mash water up to 190°F, and dumped it into the
empty mash/lauter tun to heat the equipment, with a blanket on the lid.</p>
<p>When the water had cooled to about 170°F, I slowly stirred the grain into the
tun.  After stirring and letting the mash sit for a few minutes, I measured its
temperature to be between 147°F and 149°F, which was below my target of
154°F.  <strong>However</strong>, when I later checked the temperature an hour later, it
read 154°F.  I trust the second reading, and so the initial mash temperature
was likely over 154°F.</p>
<p>After mashing for an hour, an iodine tincture test showed that there was still
starch in the solution, so I added about a quart of hot water, stirred, and let it
mash longer.</p>
<p>After another twenty minutes, an iodine tincture test still showed starch, so
I stirred and covered again at 152°F.  Old grain whose enzymes have worn off?
Or did I denature them with a too hot initial mash?</p>
<p>After another thirty minutes of mashing, there was still starch in the solution, but
at 136°F I gave up and started the sparge.</p>
<p>So, that's a 110 minute mash from somewhere above 154°F down to 136°F, never
showing complete conversion.  There is a long fly sparge ahead, though, so
maybe I ended up getting all of the sugar after all.</p>
<h2 id="sparging">Sparging</h2>
<p>Here's my fly sparging setup.</p>
<video controls="true" width="700">
  <source src="sparging.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video><p>I don't think there's really any reason to fly sparge.  Batch sparging and
no-sparge brewing proportedly work just as well at the homebrew scale, but I
don't know... I like it.  It's the most Rube Goldberg part of the process, and
in a nerdy hobby, it fits.</p>
<p>I adjust the flow rate both into and out of the lauter tun based on the level
of water above the mash as indicated by sharpie markings on the inside of the
cooler.</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Time</th><th>Level</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  <tr><td>4:06 PM</td><td>16 cm</td><td>runnings at 27<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix">°Bx</a> ≈ 1.115 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_density">SG</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>4:14 PM</td><td>17 cm</td><td>let's speed up the flow a bit</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4:23 PM</td><td>16 cm</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>4:37 PM</td><td>14 cm</td><td>refilling sparge bucket with hot tap water</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4:42 PM</td><td>16 cm</td><td>back at it again</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4:49 PM</td><td>16 cm</td><td>runnings at 8°Bx ≈ 1.0318 SG</td></tr>
</table><p>By 4:59 PM (about one hour of sparging) I had collected 8 gallons of
15°Bx ≈ 1.0611 SG wort.  I was concerned that if I let this boil down to 5
gallons, that the resulting wort would be way too strong.  I decided to let it
boil off for a while, to gague the boil off rate, and then discard some wort so
that the target 5 gallons of wort at the end of the boil had a reasonable
gravity.</p>
<h2 id="boiling">Boiling</h2>
<p>During the sparge, I collected the wort between two small pots.  When one
began to fill up, I'd switch over to the other one and then pour the fuller pot's
contents into the brew pot.  After collecting about three gallons this way, I
fired up the burners under the brew pot so that I could get a head start on
bringing the total volume of wort to a boil.</p>
<p>The hot break happened around 5:20 PM, about twenty minutes after I stopped
sparging.  What a mess.</p>
<p>At some point, I scooped a few quarts of wort out of the kettle.  Some I saved
in a tupperware container for priming bottles, and some I discarded.
The wort that I saved was at 1.068 SG.</p>
<p><a href="wort.jpg"><img src="wort_small.jpg" alt="wort set aside for priming bottles down the road" height="525"></img></a></p>
<h3 id="hop_additions">Hop Additions</h3>
<p>The recipe started with one ounce each of the four hop varieties listed in the
<a href="#ingredients">ingredients</a> section.  I planned to blend them together and do 2
ounces at 60 minutes, 1 ounce at 15 minutes, and 1 ounce at 2 minutes.  Then I
wanted to increase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Bitterness">IBUs</a> by upping the addition at 15 minutes, but I
only had one ounce of Belma total.  So, I added an additional ⅓ ounce of each
of the centennial, citra, and cascade hops to the 15 minute addition.</p>
<p>The actual hop schedule was the following:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Hop/Quantity</th><th>Boil Time</th></tr>
  <tr><td>½ oz. Citra, ½ oz. Centennial, ½ oz. Cascade, ½ oz. Belma</td><td>60 min.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> oz. Citra, <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> oz. Centennial, <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> oz. Cascade, ¼ oz. Belma</td><td>15 min.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>¼ oz. Citra, ¼ oz. Centennial, ¼ oz. Cascade, ¼ oz. Belma</td><td>2 min.</td></tr>
</table><h3 id="chilling">Chilling</h3>
<p>15 minutes before the end of the boil (around the second hop addition), I added
the wort chiller to the kettle to sanitize it.</p>
<p>At flameout, I turned on the cold water faucet and continually swirled the
chiller in the wort to cool it.</p>
<video controls="true" width="700">
  <source src="chiller.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video><p>Be sure to fasten the input line to the faucet using a wrench, or it's likely
to pop off.</p>
<video controls="true" width="700">
  <source src="thriller.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video><p>The wort cooled down to 68°F.  The original gravity of the batch was 1.082@68°F →<strong>1.083 SG</strong>.</p>
<p>Before chilling the beer, I noted the level of the wort inside the kettle to be
about 5.5 gallons hot.  Water has an expansion factor of 1.043 at 212°F, so
chilled I had around 5.3 gallons of wort.</p>
<h2 id="fermenting">Fermenting</h2>
<p>Using a sanitized, broken <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=auto+siphon">autosiphon</a>, I transferred the chilled wort to a
sanitized 5 gallon glass carboy, splashing the stream of wort as it filled the
carboy.  Then I plugged it and shook the hell out of it for several seconds.</p>
<p>I sprinkled a pack of US-05 dried ale yeast (expired in 2017) into the carboy,
fitted a blowoff tube, and placed the fermentor into the chest freezer set to
60°F.</p>
<p>After a day, there was no visible fermentation activity.  In retrospect, this
is not surprising.  A previous batch of similarly strong beer didn't start
chugging until the third day.  This time, though, I was concerned about the
strength of the wort and the viability of the expired yeast.  I've read that
dried yeast lose their viability at a rate of a couple percent <em>per year</em>, but
still...</p>
<p>So, I took <em>two</em> packs of W34/70 dried lager yeast (also expired in 2017), rehydrated them in some of the
set-aside 1.068 wort that I first diluted (arbitrarily), boiled, and 
chilled, and then dumped the whole thing into the fermentor about a day after
brewing.</p>
<p>By the following day, fermentation had taken off like a bat out of hell.</p>
<p><a href="fermentor-with-blowoff.jpg"><img src="fermentor-with-blowoff_small.jpg" alt="fermentation with blowoff tube" height="525"></img></a></p>
<p>Are both yeast strains working on the beer?  Is it just the lager yeast?  Or
maybe it's just the ale yeast, after a two day lag as before?  I don't know.</p>
<p>A few days later I replaced the blowoff tube with an airlock, and as of today
the batch is still quietly bubbling away.</p>
<p><a href="fermentor-with-airlock.jpg"><img src="fermentor-with-airlock_small.jpg" alt="fermentation with airlock" height="525"></img></a></p>
<h2 id="bottling">Bottling</h2>
<p>I plan to bottle condition this beer, priming with the 1.068 OG wort that I set
aside on brew day.  Maybe I should just use corn sugar instead, I don't know.</p>
<p>The bottles will get <a href="labels.pdf">these labels</a>, and caps that look something
like this:</p>
<p><a href="cap.png"><img src="cap.jpg" height="400"></img></a></p>
<p>The labels I'll print out on glossy paper, cut out with scissors, and then
attach to the bottles using a glue stick.  The caps I ordered from a printer
online; we'll see how they come out.</p>
<p>Yesterday I cleaned out the years of boxes, move-in artifacts, and other
detritus from the storage loft in my apartment, so now I have a tidy collection
of empty bottles that I can de-label in preparation for filling.</p>
<p><a href="empties.jpg"><img src="empties_small.jpg" alt="empty bottles" height="525"></img></a></p>
<p>The beer is not yet done fermenting, so I'll update this post come bottling
day.</p>
