Mexico, Day 5
=============

An electric fence tops the walls surrounding my neighborhood.  Presumably
this is to keep bad people out, but I can't leave unless the man at the gate
allows it.  Then again, he is unarmed, and short, and friendly.

This is my fourth full day here, and I'm happy to report that I've so far
done _nothing much_. Yesterday we went over to Grace's parents' place for a
dinner of sopa de tortilla, and listened to some records in her father's
studio man cave. We sipped fancy tequila. Otherwise I've been hanging out at
my sunny three bedroom house inside the castle walls, occasionally venturing
out to a restaurant or cafe. There's a big screen TV and a 1000-piece
puzzle. I'm becoming fond of my morning ritual of coffee and computer in the
backyard.

Bottled water is the way to go, but for making coffee you can get away with
boiling the tap for a while.  Once the water cools, there's a slick of
precipitated minerals on top, and it smells slightly of sulfur.  No wonder
the coffee tasted bland; this morning I used bottled water and it was much
improved.

I didn't realize until yesterday that Aguascalientes sits at an elevation of
over 6000 feet (1888 meters).  I've been to Aspen before, where altitude
sickness is unavoidable, whereas here I just felt a little winded and thirsty.

It's a veritable desert, but February is "Winter," so it's not too hot
during the day nor cold at night.  Don't forget to drink lots of water (but
_don't drink the water_).

My growing list of Mexican foodstuffs:

- [chilaquiles][1]
- [tacos][2]
- [sopa de tortilla][3]

I also had a chili hamburger that was the fucking bomb. Oh, and an "Italian"
restaurant. And Grace's sun-dried tomato chicken with potatoes. I've been
eating food, basically. Welcome to Mexico.

This afternoon we'll head to the supermarket again so I can attempt my salmon
recipe.  Then later we'll take a walk downtown.  Originally I planned to stay
for a week or two, but now I'm staying for a month.  For $40 per day, where
else would I be?  Hasta luego...
