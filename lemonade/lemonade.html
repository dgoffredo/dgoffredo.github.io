<h1 id="lemonade">Lemonade</h1>
<p>I've been making lemonade.  Here's how.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds of lemons</li>
<li>1Â½ cups of sugar</li>
<li>tap water</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=manual+lemon+squeezer">citrus juicer</a> (or strong hands)</li>
<li>knife (for cutting lemons)</li>
<li>colander/strainer (for removing lemons and filtering the liquid)</li>
<li>two pots</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>This recipe is based off of (almost exactly) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/hl2ehg/i_didnt_realize_lemonade_was_so_complicated/">a Reddit post</a>.</p>
<p>Cut all of the lemons in half and squeeze their juice into a pot.</p>
<p>Cut each squeezed half lemon into fourths and put into the pot with the juice.</p>
<p>Evenly sprinkle one cup of sugar over the lemons.</p>
<p>Cover the pot and let sit for thirty minutes.  No heat.</p>
<p>While that's happening, bring a half cup of sugar to a boil in a little bit of
water in another pot.  Let boil for a few minutes, and then turn off the heat
and cover the pot.</p>
<p>When the thirty minutes is up for the lemons, add six cups of water to the
lemon/juice/sugar pot, stir, and bring to a boil.  Let that boil for ten minutes.</p>
<p>After boiling for ten minutes, turn off the heat and strain into the other pot
(the one containing the boiled sugar water), removing the lemons.  I like to
give the lemons a firm poke with a wooden spoon to get any remaining liquid
out of them.</p>
<p>Using a strainer, filter the liquid back and forth between the two pots, at
least three times (I do five or six times).</p>
<p>Cover whichever pot the lemonade ended up in, and put the pot into the sink
surrounded by cold water (and ice packs, if you have them).</p>
<p>When the lemonade has cooled to room temperature (takes a while), add ice
cubes and serve with a ladle.  Or, scoop your glass into the pot because life
is short.</p>
