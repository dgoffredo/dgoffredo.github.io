Pedant Cheat Sheet
==================
I've been reading a lot of technical documentation, blog posts, StackOverflow
answers, and Reddit threads.  Some writing stands out, having an apparent
clarity, honesty, and maturity.  I notice that my writing is not as good as it
could be.  Here are some things that I'd like to work on.

Words That Don't Exist
----------------------
English contains something like 250,000 words, but these are not among them.

### homogenous
Pronounced `hō-ˈmȯ-je-nəs`, the noun derived from the verb "homogenize."  This
is not a word.  The word is "homogeneous," pronounced `hō-mə-ˈjē-nē-əs` (notice
the `e`s).

### performant
An adjective derived from the noun "performance."  But it's not a word.  Maybe
it is becoming one, thanks to us C++ programmers, but not yet.  Use "fast" or
"efficient" instead.

### condensate
You mean "condense."

### conversate
A less common mistake, but similar to above, you mean "converse."

### irregardless
You mean "regardless."

### evacipate
You mean to "time travel," or perhaps to _bill murray_ or to _carruthanize_ (an
example of _carruthenasia_).

Misused Expressions, Words, and Punctuation
-------------------------------------------
Sometimes I say something other than what I meant, because what I said doesn't
mean what I thought.

### i.e.
"i.e." is short for _id est_, which is Latin for "that is," which is used
before a restatement for clarification or illustration.  It does not introduce
an example.

### e.g.
"e.g." is short of _exempli gratia_, which is Latin for "for example," which is
used before an example.  It does not mean the same thing as "i.e.," and neither
means the same thing as the word "ergo."

### ergo
"Ergo" means "therefore" or "thus."  I see no reason to use "ergo."

### whether or not
Sometimes "whether" means "if," but more often it means "if or if not," which
would mean "whether or not" can mean "whether or not or not," which is not what
you meant.  Instead, you can say "regardless of whether."  This is not a
definite rule, though, since "whether you like it or not" is an acceptable
phrase, even though "regardless of whether you like it" means the same thing,
as does "regardless of if you like it."  What I think is wrong, though, is to
say, "I don't know whether or not you like it."  In this case, you could say
"I don't know whether you like it," and so the "or not" is redundant.  You
might argue that in this last example, the additional "or not" emphasizes that
I am unsure about the outcome, rather than am concerned about the positive
outcome, but you also might not.  "I don't know whether you like it" is clearer
than "I don't know if you like it," though, since it avoids the potential
ambiguity with "you like it" being a sufficient condition for "I don't know."

### quotes, "punctuation", and how they combine
This is a rule that I learned in school, and I still disagree with it, but
rules are rules.  When punctation would logically follow a closing quotation,
"like this," the punctuation must instead go just before the closing quote.
The justification I heard is that "it looks better."  It's infuriating because
it creates ambiguity when you end a sentence with a quote.  Peter read the text
"Paul asked a question?"

### OCD
OCD is an initialism for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and is a noun, not an
adjective.  You cannot "be OCD," and you cannot "get OCD about" something.
"Obsessive compulsive," however, is an adjective, but "being OC" is not in use.

### acronym versus initialism
An acronym is pronounced as a word, e.g. NASA, OPEC, ASCII, and FUBAR.  Many
first-letter-of-every-word abbreviations, though, are not acronyms, since they
are not pronounced as a word, but instead are only initialisms, such as CPU,
LRU, and the NAACP.

### essentially, basically, and in essence
These adverbs, like many adverbs, can be omitted without changing the meaning.

Clichés
-------
Sometimes I say something because it's close enough to what I mean, and I know
it will create the desired association in the mind of the listener, but it's
not exectly what I mean.  I'd do better to avoid that.

### at this point in time
You mean "now."  If using the simple word "now" makes what you're saying sound
silly or insubstantial, then maybe what you're saying is silly or
insubstantial.

### going forward
This means "eventually," or "in the future."  I prefer either of those
alternatives.

### low-hanging fruit
Besides being a bad image, this means "easy tasks."

### quick win
You mean "easy task."

### fail
You mean "failure."  I'm less critical about using "feel" where you mean
"feeling," for some reason.

### grow organically
Usually when planning software that must be delivered quickly.  This is a
euphemism for "worry about it later," or "whatever."  Stronger would be
"neglect design."  Generous would be "it won't matter."

### professional
Anyone who does something for money is a professional.  Anything used in such
a profession is professional.  Usually this word is (unbeknownst to the
speaker) a euphemism for "pretentious," "obedient," or "orthodox."  A generous
alternative is "civil."

### stability
This is used instead of "not breaking."  What stable actually means is
"established."  I prefer to distinguish between the two.  Stable can also mean
"not wavering," so I see the intent, but software that has never worked is also
stable.

### accountability
You mean "culpability."  The term "accountability" is not mentioned when one is
being held accountable for success.

### bike-shedding
This is a nice bit of jargon to describe something that happens a lot in
computer programming, but it's a cliché.  I think "bickering" might be an
alternative.

### yak-shaving
Honestly I haven't heard this one too much, but I've read it a lot, and used it
before.  Alternatives are "working" or "preparing" ("work," "preparation").

### driving
You mean "managing."

Editing
-------
I try to keep in mind the points above when I'm editing my writing, which I
don't do nearly enough.  Sometimes I end up having to throw away what I've
written and replace it with something that is simpler and more honest, but then
it's less likely to be wrong.
