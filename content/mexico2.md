Mexico, Day 8
=============

I haven't done my own laundry in a while. In this arid climate, you hardly
even need to hang the clothes to dry.

The salmon came out well.  Luxurious though this stove may be, its lowest
setting is more flame than I'd like, so I'm learning how not to burn things.

Grace and I ubered downtown in the afternoon to check things out. My
favorite moment was when we sat at a small cafe table outside in a "codo" of
shops under the shade of some large trees. I don't have a picture of it. I
had a small vanilla ice cream and Grace had [churros][1].  Grace managed to
get pooped on by one of the birds above. She was momentarily inconsolable.

After downtown, we had a 5:00 dinner date with Grace's parents. The menu was
[carne asada][2] and "tacos gorda," an invention of Grace's.  They call her
"Gorda" because she was a fat baby, and because Mexicans have a habit of
choosing contrary nicknames.

Tacos Gorda contain slices carne asada with grilled buttered potatoes and carmelized onions, together in a tortilla with [salsa verde][3].  They're so good.

After some wine and some beer, we switched to tequila.  Things got festive.
This is how Grace's mother, Graciela, reacts when you point a camera at her
and say "¡Oye, bonita!"

Here she is with her husband, Manuel.

Here's Grace and yours truly.

After dinner, we put away the picnic table and moved into the kitchen to play
dominoes.  Can you believe that I'd never played before?  There was more
tequila, or as Grace called it, "truth serum."  Grace's mom is quick with
arithmetic.

The following morning I was "crudo," but the tequila must have been of very
high quality, because I felt well by 11 AM, a personal record.

The following afternoon we hung out at Grace's parents' again, this time
listening to Grace's newly bought The Police vinyls, and then a round of
[Pictionary][4].  I like them.

Try playing Pictionary in Spanish.

I will not run out of water.
