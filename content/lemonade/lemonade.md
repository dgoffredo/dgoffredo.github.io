Lemonade
========
I've been making lemonade.  Here's how.

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 pounds of lemons
- 1Â½ cups of sugar
- tap water

Equipment
---------
- [citrus juicer][1] (or strong hands)
- knife (for cutting lemons)
- colander/strainer (for removing lemons and filtering the liquid)
- two pots

Procedure
---------
This recipe is based off of (almost exactly) [a Reddit post][2].

Cut all of the lemons in half and squeeze their juice into a pot.

Cut each squeezed half lemon into fourths and put into the pot with the juice.

Evenly sprinkle one cup of sugar over the lemons.

Cover the pot and let sit for thirty minutes.  No heat.

While that's happening, bring a half cup of sugar to a boil in a little bit of
water in another pot.  Let boil for a few minutes, and then turn off the heat
and cover the pot.

When the thirty minutes is up for the lemons, add six cups of water to the
lemon/juice/sugar pot, stir, and bring to a boil.  Let that boil for ten minutes.

After boiling for ten minutes, turn off the heat and strain into the other pot
(the one containing the boiled sugar water), removing the lemons.  I like to
give the lemons a firm poke with a wooden spoon to get any remaining liquid
out of them.

Using a strainer, filter the liquid back and forth between the two pots, at
least three times (I do five or six times).

Cover whichever pot the lemonade ended up in, and put the pot into the sink
surrounded by cold water (and ice packs, if you have them).

When the lemonade has cooled to room temperature (takes a while), add ice
cubes and serve with a ladle.  Or, scoop your glass into the pot because life
is short.
