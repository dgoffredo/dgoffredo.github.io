<h1 id="code_generation_and_the_minimum_feedback_arc_set">Code Generation and the Minimum Feedback Arc Set</h1>
<p>I ran into a graph problem a while back, and finally decided to write about it.</p>
<h2 id="generating_c_classes">Generating C++ Classes</h2>
<p>One day I'll write a <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/bde/blob/master/groups/bdl/bdlat/doc/bdlat.txt">bdlat</a>-compatible C++ class
<a href="https://github.com/dgoffredo/bat-codegen">generator</a>. It will allow you to write things like <code>basic.bdlat</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(package basic

  (import core)

  (type Value
    "a generic value in a restricted type system"
    (choice
      ("integer"  core/integer)
      ("decimal"  core/decimal)
      ("string"   core/string)
      ("optional" (optional Value))
      ("array"    (array Value))))
</code></pre>
<p>and then do something like</p>
<pre><code>$ bat-codegen --language c++ --toplevel Lakos --component types basic.bdlat
</code></pre>
<p>to produce the files <code>basic_types.h</code> and <code>basic_types.cpp</code> containing the C++
class <code>Lakos::basic::Value</code>.</p>
<p>Here's a first shot at what the definition of <code>Lakos::basic::Value</code> might look
like:</p>
<pre><code>class Value {
    bdlb::Variant&lt;int64_t,
                  bdldfp::Decimal64,
                  bsl::string,
                  bdlb::NullableValue&lt;Value&gt;,
                  bsl::vector&lt;Value&gt; &gt; 
        d_data;

  public:
      // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>A real implementation would need to account for choice elements having the same
type, and so the types in the <code>Variant</code> would each have to be tagged with a
distinct integer, but let's ignore that for now.</p>
<p>We've already run into worse trouble, because this code won't even compile.
<code>Value</code>'s size depends on its own size. To work around this, a level of
indirection is needed. Suppose the class template <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> were a
wrapper around a heap-allocated <code>T</code> referred to by a <code>T*</code>, but with value
semantics rather than pointer semantics (i.e. copying the <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>
copies the referred to <code>T</code> instance). Then <code>Value</code> can be defined as:</p>
<pre><code>class Value {
    bdlb::Variant&lt;int64_t,
                  bdldfp::Decimal64,
                  bsl::string,
                  Allocated&lt;bdlb::NullableValue&lt;Value&gt; &gt;,
                  Allocated&lt;bsl::vector&lt;Value&gt; &gt; &gt;
        d_data;

  public:
    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>That would work, because <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>'s size is independent of <code>T</code>.</p>
<h2 id="larger_cycles">Larger Cycles</h2>
<p>When a type depends upon itself, it doesn't necessarily do so by having itself
as a member (as was nearly the case with <code>Value</code> above). It could be that the
type contains a type that contains the original type. Or it could be that the
type contains a type that contains a type that contains the original type, etc.</p>
<p>Generally, a type <code>A</code> <em>contains</em> a type <code>B</code> if any of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code> is a sequence or a choice having an element of type <code>B</code></li>
<li><code>A</code> is a sequence or a choice having an element of type <code>(optional B)</code></li>
<li><code>A</code> is a sequence or a choice having an element of type <code>(array B)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can think of a set of types as a directed graph where an edge points from
<code>A</code> to <code>B</code> if <code>A</code> <em>contains</em> <code>B</code>. Let's call such a directed graph a dependency
graph.</p>
<p>Then <code>A</code> <em>depends upon</em> <code>B</code> if <code>A</code> <em>contains</em> <code>B</code> or if <code>A</code> <em>contains</em> a <code>C</code>
where <code>C</code> <em>depends upon</em> <code>B</code>. That is, <code>A</code> <em>depends upon</em> <code>B</code> if there exists a
directed path from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> in the dependency graph.</p>
<p>The graph for the types in <code>(package basic ...)</code>, above, looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../site/just-value.dot.png" alt="dependency graph of &quot;Value&quot;" /></p>
<p>It has one vertex and one edge, from <code>Value</code> to itself: because (before our
modification) <code>Value</code> <em>contains</em> <code>Value</code>. Our modification, though, creates
a level of indirection: replacing <code>Value</code> with <code>Allocated&lt;Value&gt;</code> within the
class definition removes the one edge in the graph, since <code>Value</code> no longer
contains <code>Value</code>:</p>
<p><img src="../site/bare-value.dot.png" alt="no more cycle" /></p>
<p>A cycle involving only one vertex is not very interesting. But suppose the
dependency graph looked like this instead:</p>
<p><img src="../site/cyclic.dot.png" alt="a more complicated dependency graph" /></p>
<p>How many cycles does that directed graph contain? I see two:</p>
<div><img src="../site/cyclic.1.dot.png" /><img src="../site/cyclic.2.dot.png" /></div><p>As before, we wish to make this directed graph acyclic by removing edges, where
we remove an edge by replacing the appearance of a type <code>T</code> within a class
definition with <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Which edges should be removed?</p>
<p>Perhaps only because of the way the graph is drawn, I'm tempted to think of the
vertex <code>D</code> as the "main" type in the schema, and that makes me want to remove
the two edges inbound into it:</p>
<div><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.1.dot.png" /><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.2.dot.png" /></div><p>The graph now has no cycles. In fact, it would be a tree were it not for <code>B</code>
having two parents (<code>A</code> and <code>F</code>). Also, note that since this is a <em>directed</em>
graph, the edge sequence <code>FA</code>, <code>AB</code>, <code>BF</code> is not a path, and thus not a
cycle, because the edge between <code>B</code> and <code>F</code> goes from <code>F</code> to <code>B</code>, not the
other way around.</p>
<p>What we did from the C++ point of view is go into the definitions of the <code>A</code>
and <code>G</code> classes and replace all appearances of <code>D</code> with <code>Allocated&lt;D&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that there is another way we could have broken the
cycles. Here's the original cyclic graph again:</p>
<p><img src="../site/cyclic.dot.png" alt="a more complicated dependency graph" /></p>
<p>Both cycles share an edge, <code>DF</code>, and removing just that one breaks both
cycles:</p>
<div><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.3.dot.png" /><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.4.dot.png" /></div><p>Now graphviz wants to put <code>F</code> on top, interesting.</p>
<h2 id="tradeoffs">Trade-offs</h2>
<p>What's the difference between the two de-cyclings demonstrated above? My first
thought was that less is more, and so removing the cycles by adding only one
<code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> is better than adding two. That's not a fully reasoned argument,
though.</p>
<p>It's true that there is a cost associated with the level of indirection
introduced by <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>. Whenever you want to read or write to
something in that member, you have to chase a pointer, rather than just work
at an offset from the parent object. Also, when the <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> is
created, it must <em>allocate</em> space for the <code>T</code>. That cost might or might not
be significant depending on how memory is allocated.</p>
<p>How much is the total cost, though? Suppose that we replaced <em>every</em> member
of every class with <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>, as is done in dynamic and "object
oriented" languages. Would a running program notice the difference? Would
all the concern about "cache friendliness" matter?</p>
<p>Here's another thought. If the object of type <code>T</code> that you are replacing with an
<code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> is much larger than <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> on the stack, and if access to
that <code>T</code> would have been infrequent anyway, it might actually be advantageous
to "tuck away" the rarely accessed member to allow adjacent objects to remain
in cache more often.</p>
<p>Nothing but a good suite of benchmarks could answer these questions.</p>
<p>Still, we have to at least get the code to compile. Making <em>everything</em> an
<code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> seems at least unnecessary, if not detrimental. How, then, do
we decide which edges to remove from our cyclic graphs?</p>
<h2 id="the_minimum_feedback_arc_set">The Minimum Feedback Arc Set</h2>
<p>Simple but suboptimal would be to say: "Any type that appears in a cycle must
be referred to only by <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code>." This makes certain that all cycles are
removed, but potentially introduces many more <code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> than necessary.</p>
<p>In the previous example, it would mean removing five edges instead of one:</p>
<div><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.5.dot.png" /><img src="../site/cyclic.remove.6.dot.png" /></div><p>Also, if there were edges coming in from other vertices into any of the vertices
<code>A</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>F</code>, or <code>G</code>, those edges too would be removed, even though they aren't
part of either cycle.</p>
<p>It seems a waste, but on the other hand, maybe it's simple to implement:
just walk through the graph with a clipboard, noting all of the nodes
appearing in cycles, and you're done. Surprisingly, enumerating all of the
cycles in a directed graph efficiently is <a href="https://blog.mister-muffin.de/2012/07/04/enumerating-elementary-circuits-of-a-directed_graph/">nontrivial</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that there can be an awful lot of cycles in a directed graph.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete directed graph</a> having <var>n</var> vertices and
<var>~n<sup>2</sup></var> edges can have up to <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GA/homeworks/hw1/Johnson%2075.PDF">this many</a> (simple)
cycles:</p>
<p><img src="../site/max-cycles.dot.png" alt="maximum number of cycles in complete digraph with n vertices" /></p>
<p>That's way more than <var>2<sup>n</sup></var>, so at worst we're totally
screwed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no schema describing C++ classes is going to have a <em>complete</em>
dependency graph. Even if it were complete, then <var>n</var> would be small.</p>
<p>So, the shotgun method of "<code>Allocated&lt;T&gt;</code> for every <code>T</code> appearing in a cycle" is
still on the table, but can we do better?</p>
<p>What about the <em>smallest</em> set of edges we'd need to remove to make the
dependency graph acyclic? How do we calculate that set? In the example, above,
the answer is just the one edge <code>DF</code> — we can't remove <em>zero</em> edges, and
removing the <em>one</em> edge <code>DF</code> does the trick, and so that must be the smallest
set (assuming there is no other single edge that could be removed instead, and
there isn't).</p>
<p>The problem of finding the size (cardinality) of a minimal set of edges to
remove from a cyclic directed graph to render it acyclic is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set#Minimum_feedback_arc_set">the
minimum feedback arc set problem</a>, and it's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-complete</a>, which <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/ms/minimum_feedback_arc_set.pdf">sucks</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently the solution can be approximated to an arbitrary level of accuracy,
but unless I find a tested implementation of one of the approximate or complete
solutions in an off-the-shelf graph library, I'm not about to implement it
myself for a code generator.</p>
<h2 id="a_potential_compromise">A Potential Compromise</h2>
<p>I've come up with an algorithm that spits out a set of edges to remove from a
directed graph to render it acyclic, and as far as I can reason its worse case
time complexity is a polynomial in <code>n</code>, the number of vertices, and <code>e</code>, the
number of edges.</p>
<p>Now, maybe I'm wrong about that complexity, but regardless, either the
algorithm is more complex than I think, or it's doesn't always find the
<em>minimum</em> feedback arc set (or both). Because <var>P ≠ NP</var>. Probably.</p>
<p>Still seems pretty good to me, though. Here's how it works.</p>
<h3 id="words">Words</h3>
<p>The idea is to do a depth-first search for "cyclic edges," trying multiple
times, once for each vertex. The result is then the smallest of the sets of
"cyclic edges" found. If there multiple disconnected subgraphs, then the result
is the smallest union of the results from all subgraphs.</p>
<p>Choose a starting vertex, say, <code>A</code>. Walk the directed graph depth-first,
keeping track of ancestor nodes using a hash set <code>s</code> (i.e. add nodes "on the
way down" and remove them "on the way back up" — or mark the vertices in
place, if possible).</p>
<p>If you re-encounter an ancestor in your set <code>s</code> while traversing the graph,
note which edge brought you to the ancestor, take a step back (across that
edge) and then proceed as if that edge did not exist. That edge is what I called
a "cyclic edge," above.</p>
<p>This procedure will give you a set of edges removed from the graph in order
to make it acyclic <strong><em>from <code>A</code>'s point of view</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The hunch of this algorithm is that if you repeat the procedure starting at
each other vertex as well, then maybe you'll stumble upon the minimum
feedback arc set.</p>
<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>
<p>Here is an animated example using the same graph we've been using.</p>
<p>Start at vertex <code>A</code> and do a depth-first traversal until you run into trouble:</p>
<p><img src="../site/graph-animation-1.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>In these animations, the purple (pink) node is the one from which we started,
blue indicates the edge or vertex we're currently examining, and gray indicates
an edge or vertex that we've already visited. Red marks edges that lead to a
vertex in the current set <code>s</code> of ancestors.</p>
<p>We detected that the edge <code>FA</code> creates a cycle, so we remember it, remove it,
and continue:</p>
<p><img src="../site/graph-animation-2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>We detected that the edge <code>GD</code> creates a cycle, and so we did as before. Now
there's little left to do, from <code>A</code>'s point of view:</p>
<p><img src="../site/graph-animation-3.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Thus the following two edges were removed to make the graph acyclic, starting
from <code>A</code>:</p>
<p><img src="../site/edges-removed-a.dot.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Next we do the whole thing over, but this time starting from <code>B</code>. Starting from
<code>B</code> or <code>C</code> is not very interesting, since they're both leaves. The algorithm,
having run out of tree at <code>B</code> and noticing that there were still unvisited
edges, would proceed starting from another vertex, say, <code>A</code>. But we already did
<code>A</code>. So this adds no new information.</p>
<p>The next interesting vertex to start from, alphabetically, is <code>D</code>. Here is the
complete animation starting from <code>D</code>, and then the resulting edges removed:</p>
<div><img src="../site/graph-animation-4.gif" /><img src="../site/edges-removed-d.png" /></div><p>As you can see, one of the edges is different than before.</p>
<p>The punchline is the result starting from <code>F</code>. Here it is:</p>
<div><img src="../site/graph-animation-5.gif" /><img src="../site/edges-removed-f.png" /></div><p>So we discover that the minimum feedback arc set of this directed graph is
<code>{DF}</code>.</p>
<h3 id="correctness">Correctness</h3>
<p>As I said before, this algorithm can't be right. What might help is a
<a href="https://github.com/josch/cycle_test">test suite</a> that randomly generates directed graphs, and then compares
the result of this algorithm with the result of brute-force checking the power
set of the graph's edges. I could hope to find a counter-example that way,
though none very large, since the brute force solution is exponential in the
number of edges.</p>
