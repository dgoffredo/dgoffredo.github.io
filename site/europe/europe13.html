<h1 id="europe_day_13">Europe, Day 13</h1>
<p>I'm aboard the Arlanda Express, on my way towards a nine hour flight.
Fortunately, in addition to being an airplane, the vessel will be also a
time machine, so I'll arrive in New York only two hours after departing.</p>
<p>We stayed just outside of central Stockholm at a friend's apartment, which
has a balcony whose view is this:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-1_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Our host looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-3_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The first full day he took us around in his car to see some scenic areas of
Stockholm:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-2_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>and we went to a museum about this old boat they found buried in the ocean
and managed to restore with 98% of the original material. There were floors
in the museum on things like the curing process used in the waterlogged
wood, the skeletons of the crew, and a bunch of other interesting stuff that
you wouldn't expect to find explained in such detail. I rather liked it. The
boat itself is gigantic:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-5_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The following day we drove out to a boat to take a ferry to one of
Stockholm's many islands. It was a nice ride:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-4_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-7_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once on the island, we took a cable barge to a smaller island where there's
an old fort:</p>

<p><img src="europe13-9_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-8_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-12_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-10_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-11_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="europe13-13_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hobbits live there:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-14_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then we took the ferry back around sundown:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-15_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>and headed into a pub in the city center to watch the "Sweden versus Europe"
world hockey semi-final. Sweden lost. C'est la vie. The city looks nice at
dusk:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-16_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>and they have balloons:</p>
<p><img src="europe13-17_small.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I have so far resisted the cesspool of disease otherwise known as Vineet,
but we'll see how I fare waking up for work tomorrow. Ciao.</p>
