Content
=======
This directory contains the authored content of the website: posts, images,
etc.  The generator takes this directory, along with other files in
[../config/][1], to render a static website in [../site/][2].

Pages are written in Markdown format, and have the `.md` file extension.
See, for example, [phone-server.md][3].

[1]: ../config
[2]: ../site
[3]: phone-server.md
