Europe, Day 7
=============
Greetings from Gatwick,

The flight into Madrid is a bit late. I'll take this time to catch you up on
what I did in London. For example, at some point we encountered a monument:

I daresay it was monumental. Here's what it looks like with the sun behind it:

That day we also walked along the Thames and saw Tower Bridge from London
Bridge:

and Tower Bridge from Tower Bridge:

There were interesting alleys:

and vintage dental equipment (at the science museum):

Later that day we met up with some Bloomberg people (we're everywhere) for a
few pints and a burger. Even one of my New York based managers showed up. Small
world.

The next day we took a train out to Greenwich, where the time is mean. The
ceiling paintings and chapels are less mean, however:

and the parks are nice:

I named the fields around Greenwich "Jurassic Park" on account of the large
number and density of giant ravens and geese that saunter around.

Coming down from the hill we ended up in a town called Blackheath, where we
stopped into a pub for some food and saw a little local philosophy:

Apparently the pigeons have a lot to be concerned about in London, since even
pelicans will eat them. What? Yes, in London, pelicans (there are pelicans) eat
pigeons (which are not fish). If you don't believe me, google it. I must warn
you, though, it's graphic.

Today while Vineet got brunch with an old family friend, I opted to head back
into central London and pay a quick visit to the British Museum, where I
observed the Roman god of wine dancing with his panther, as only the Roman god
of wine can:

Vamos a Madrid!
