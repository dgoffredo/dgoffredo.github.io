The Stew
========
![the finished bowl of stew](bowl_small.webp)

I've been tweaking this vegetable and chicken stew recipe.  Here it is as of
today.

Ingredients
-----------
![ingredients before prepping](ingredients_small.webp)

That's between $40 and $50 of stuff from my local grocery store.  I already had
the soy sauce, mustard, black pepper, and lentils.  The sauces, spices, barley,
corn, and lentils will last for multiple batches, but the rest will be consumed
by today's recipe.  It makes between one and two gallons of stew.

Usually I chop as I go, but for the sake of this picture today I prepped
everything in advance:

![ingredients after prepping](ingredients-prepped_small.webp)

Here's the list of ingredients in recipe order:

- black pepper, crushed, a lot throughout the recipe
- vegetable oil, enough to coat the bottom of the pot
- chicken thighs, 4 browned and sliced (1.84 lbs.)
- celery, 3 stalks chopped
- carrot, 1 large chunked (0.97 lbs.)
- onion, yellow, 1 diced (0.7 lbs.)
- garlic, 6-8 cloves coarsely diced
- peppers, green bell, 1 sliced (0.65 lbs.)
- peppers, jalapeño, 3 sliced (0.31 lbs.)
- okra, sliced, 12 oz.
- tomatoes, 6 cut into eighths (1.97 lbs.)
- parsley, Italian, 1 bunch chopped
- basil, 1 bunch chopped
- stock, 1 quart
- potatoes, red bliss, 2 chopped (0.95 lbs.)
- collard greens, 1 bunch chopped (0.82 lbs.)
- soy sauce, dark, 2 tbsp.
- mustard, brown, 1 tbsp.
- mushrooms, portabello, chunked, 16 oz.
- mushrooms, shitake, sliced, 10 oz.
- barley, 1/2 cup
- lentils, 1/4 cup
- corn, 1/2 cup

Three jalapeños is the right amount of spice for me: enough to notice but not
enough to burn.  If I were making this for my parents, I'd use one instead.

Procedure
---------
The stove will be on high heat until all of the liquids are added.

Brown the chicken.  Get some vegetable oil blazing hot, tong the thighs into
the pot skin side down, and watch out for splatters.  Once the thighs are
willing to be picked up without sticking too much, flip them.

![chicken browning](chicken_small.webp)

![other side](chicken-2_small.webp)

You're not cooking the chicken, you're just developing some browning and
getting schmaltzy goodness into the pot.

![chicken after](chicken-after_small.webp)

Don't worry about burnt bits stuck to the pot.  That's the good stuff, and it
will come off easily once the onions, carrots, and celery are added.

![mirepoix](mirepoix_small.webp)

Mix, stir, scrape, and add black pepper.

After a few minutes, add the garlic.

![garlic before](garlic-before_small.webp)

![garlic after](garlic-after_small.webp)

You'll smell the garlic as soon as it goes in.  Give that a minute and then add
the peppers.

![peppers](peppers_small.webp)

Stir occasionally, but don't be afraid to let some browned sticky stuff happen
on the bottom of the pot.  That will all come off when you add the tomatoes.

First, the okra.

![okra before](okra-before_small.webp)

![okra after](okra-after_small.webp)

Okra adds slimy mucilage, which I'm thinking thickens the stew.  It might also
help slow down browning, which at this point is happening fast at the bottom of
that pot.

Let that go a little bit until you're worried about things sticking too much.
Customize the recipe to match your level of anxiety. Then add the tomatoes and
scrape the bottom of the pot as if you're deglazing.

More black pepper.

![tomatoes before](tomatoes-before_small.webp)

![tomatoes after](tomatoes-after_small.webp)

It won't take long for the tomatoes to break down and become soupy.  At that
point, add the parsley and basil, and scrape the bottom of the pot again.  Be
careful not to burn your knuckles with the steam that will billow from the
disturbed liquid.

![herbs before](herbs-before_small.webp)

![herbs after](herbs-after_small.webp)

Now add the stock, scraping any remaining stuff from the bottom of the pot.
When the liquid eventually returns to a boil, reduce the stove's heat to
maintain a simmer.  In the mean time, you can add a few more ingredients.

The potatoes, now that they can't stick:

The collard greens:

![greens after](greens-after_small.webp)

Remember the chicken?  Now that it's cooled down, carve off as much meat as you
can.  Cut the pieces into bite sized chunks and add them to the pot.  Save the
bones, cartilage, and skin in the freezer for making next time's stock.

![sliced chicken 2](sliced-chicken-2_small.webp)

![sliced chicken after](sliced-chicken-after_small.webp)

![sliced chicken scraps](sliced-chicken-scraps_small.webp)

This recipe can accommodate five chicken thighs instead of four.  My grocery
store sells packs of four and packs of six, so I usually go for four.

Now's a good time to add the soy sauce and the mustard.  The mustard smells
like too much at first, but mellows out after a few minutes.  The soy sauce is
primarily for the salt, but also adds color and complements the umami of the
mushrooms that you'll add next.

![sauces](sauces_small.webp)

![mushrooms before](mushrooms-before_small.webp)

![mushrooms after](mushrooms-after_small.webp)

Let the mushrooms simmer for a couple of minutes, and then add the barley and
lentils.

![grains](grains_small.webp)

Set a timer for thirty minutes.  Five minutes before it expires, add the corn.

![corn before](corn-before_small.webp)

![corn after](corn-after_small.webp)

When the timer goes off, you're done.  Turn off the stove and cover the stew.
It tastes best once it's cooled down a bit.

The celery had leaves on it, so I used it as garnish.

Making the Stock
----------------
You can just use vegetable or chicken stock bought from the store, or bouillon
cubes.  That's what I did.

But it wasn't fussy enough.  I like to fuss.

Also, this recipe generates a lot of vegetable waste, and I'm not composting
anymore, and I have this slow cooker, so...

Save your scraps in the freezer, and then put them in the slow cooker.

![stock ingredients](stock-ingredients_small.webp)

![stock meat first](stock-meat-first_small.webp)

![stock then veggies](stock-then-veggies_small.webp)

![stock dry](stock-dry_small.webp)

Add a sprinkling of whole peppercorns, a few bay leaves, and a bit of whichever
savory spices you can spare.

![stock spices](stock-spices_small.webp)

Use just enough water (and/or last batch's stock) to nearly cover the scraps.

![stock wet](stock-wet_small.webp)

Put on the lid, set the slow cooker to "low," and ignore it for a day or two.

![stock sit](stock-sit_small.webp)

Your home will reek of deliciousness.  You'll wake up from dreams of mirepoix.
You'll leave and come back having forgotten about the stock and wonder _what
the hell is that wonderful smell?_

Later the next day, here's what it looks like:

![stock done](stock-done_small.webp)

Strain out the solids and let it drip for a while.

![stock strain](stock-strain_small.webp)

![stock drip](stock-drip_small.webp)

![stock store](stock-store_small.webp)

![stock cold](stock-cold_small.webp)

After a day in the refrigerator, the remaining solids sink to the bottom, and
the fat forms a layer on top.  It's dark from all of the vegetable skins, I
think.
