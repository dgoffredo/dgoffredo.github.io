Boxy Brown Porter
=================
Today I brewed a porter recipe from the [internet][2].  It says:

> The recipe is one of Ron Pattinson's historic recreations based on Whitbread brewing logs.

It's supposedly from 1880 and is called "Whitbread Porter."  I'm going to
call it "Boxy Brown Porter."

Mash
----
Here's what the [strike water temperature calculator][1] had to say:

<table>
  <tr><td>Grain Weight</td><td>11.5 pounds</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Grain Temperature</td><td>82° F</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Strike Water Amount</td><td>4 gallons</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Target Mash Temperature</td><td>154° F</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Equipment Loss</td><td>0° F (preheated)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Strike Water Temperature</td><td>164.4° F</td></tr>
</table>

In practice, I might have mashed in a little too hot.  It's hard to tell,
because temperature readings vary widely depending on where in the mash I
stick the thermometer.   My notes say that the "mash is somewhere between
151°F and 157°F, depending on where I measure it."

After mashing for an hour and a half (went out to dinner), the mash was
"between 149°F and 153°F, depending on where I measure."

An iodine tincture test showed that there was no starch remaining.

Sparge
------
I did a fly sparge, collecting seven gallons of wort in about an hour.

I didn't write down the gravity of the runnings.

Boil
----
Don't brew in my apartment during the Summer.  The windows don't open much, and
the only windows are in the front, so there's no way to create a cross breeze.
The window air conditioning unit can't keep up with the stove, especially with
two burners going full blast.  The result is that the temperature and humidity
in the apartment continually rise throughout the boil.  It must have been over
100° F and 100% humidity by the time I turned off the burners.

I started heating the wort as I was collecting it during the sparge.  My notes
say that there was a rolling boil at 8:26 PM, though it was probably already
boiling before then.  I started the first (and only) hop addition at 8:41 PM,
so that's at least 15 minutes of boiling before the 60 minute addition.

I added the 3 oz. of East Kent Goldings pellets (4.4% AA) and boiled them for
60 minutes.  Then I turned off the burners, started the chiller, and turned on
the air conditioner...

The result was five gallons of wort with a **starting gravity of 1.052**.  If
that ferments down to 1.010, which it usually does, then it'll be 5.5% ABV.

The yeast was a fresh packet of [S-04][3] ale yeast, stirred into some wort and
then poured into the fermentor.

Fermentation
------------
I affixed a blowoff tube to the carboy and put it into the chest freezer set to
60° F.

Two days later, this is what I had:

![beer explosion, angle 1](poop1_small.webp)

![beer explosion, angle 2](poop2_small.webp)

![beer explosion, angle 3](poop3_small.webp)

![beer explosion, angle 4](poop4_small.webp)

Lessons learned:

1. Use a wider blowoff tube.
2. Leave some more headroom.
3. S-04 is a beast.

I cleaned up the mess and replaced the tube with an airlock.

Bottling (July 2, 2021)
-----------------------
![filled beer bottles](filled_small.webp)

We got 42 bottles of porter, plus one partially filled.  Not bad, considering
that the fermentor exploded.

The hydrometer read 1.014 at 64° F, which means the **final gravity was 1.014**,
which means the beer is **5.0% ABV**.

I primed the beer with 1¼ cups of pale dried malt extract boiled in about a
quart of water and cooled.

The beer tastes good flat.  Let's give it a few weeks to carbonate before the
first tasting.
