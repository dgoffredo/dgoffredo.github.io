India, Day 10
=============

He didn't get left behind, after all.  It should have occurred to me earlier
to search for the marble elephant in a marble room.

Asha and Vineet are now married.  They were already married, but now they still
are.

Here was my view of the beginning of the ceremony:

After a while, the staff began bringing in chairs, so by remaining standing I
got a better view of what was going on.  Asha and Vineet were sitting on a
bench opposite a small fire.  On the other side was a priest with a microphone.

I should mention that the wedding couple are not visible in the video (they're
off to the left), and that the shaking image is due to coffee.

This ritual likely had a deep significance for a few attending, but not for the
bride or groom.

At Indian weddings, women have [henna][1] drawn on their bodies in a style
known as [mehndi][2].  Here is Asha the bride:

Here is Asha the cat:

The mehndi artist applies the henna as a paste, carefully decorating the skin
as a pastry chef would.

Immediately after, it looks like this:

The women then are unable to use their hands for well over an hour.  It was
hilarious.

After the henna has dried and been scratched off onto a torn piece of
newspaper, the stained skin starts to gradually darken from a iodine orange to
a deep red brown.  Here's Andrea a day after:

Speaking of Andrea, check her out.  She borrowed this [sari (saree)][3] from
the groom's mother.

I was wearing my blue suit.  You've already seen it.  If you really want to
see more, then I refer you to any of the ten million photographers hired for
the wedding.

Oh, I just remembered the band that played during the first event.  They were
told to turn down on at least two separate occasions, but the Force was strong
with them.

Later that evening, a different band played Hotel California.  The guitar solo
was on point.  The vocals were better than I could do.

Here's what you can see from my room:

and here's what you can see from the pool:

and that's about all I shot.

Reading the complimentary Hindustan Times this morning over breakfast, I was
surprised to see no fewer than three rape-related articles.  Now, I know that
newspapers tend to focus on the morbid and sensational, and that 1.3 billion
people live in India, but still:

- "DCW to help in rehabilitating Unnao rape victim"
- "Raj minor kills herself after gang rape"
- "Man held for raping minor daughter"

In the [novel][4] I'm reading, a shelter for battered women and themes
involving abuse, rape, and incest feature prominently. I'm not sure what all
this is trying to tell me.

Here is a marble elephant.

At eight o'clock I'll be meeting a new friend for dinner and then getting up
rather early tomorrow for a flight to [Kerala][5], where the second half of
this trip begins.
