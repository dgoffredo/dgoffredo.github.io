Nha Trang

Goodbye, Ho Chi Minh City.

Hello, Nha Trang.

Before we left, I repaired the handle on my suitcase.  All it took was Pasha's
Soviet era scissors, a roll of local nylon yarn, a chopstick, some packing
tape, and a little patience.  I got the yarn and the tape from the hardware
district in Ho Chi Minh. Paid way too much for the yarn.  The tape was okay.

If you're thinking "why not just buy a new suitcase?" then you are so missing
the point.  This suitcase was on its way to the landfill, abandoned and
neglected.  Now it is my pet.  My precious pet suitcase.  My janky socks box.

We haven't seen the sun yet, and it rains constantly.  That's a little
disappointing for a beach destination, but there are other things to do.

This afternoon we walked through town in the rain on our way to another
pagoda, [Long SÆ¡n Pagoda][1].  Rest assured, Nha Trang also has alleyways.

Across the tracks and up a number of steps there is a campus of shrines and
statues, including this one of the reposed Buddha.

And this one of the enthroned Buddha.

I was into the views of the surrounding city, and some careful gardening by who
I imagine must be some of the monks.

At the bottom of the facility is a small labyrinth of shrine cubbies, like some
kind of vertical graveyard.  Each occupied square contained a plaque with a
picture of the deceased, their name, lifetime, some incense, and oil for flame.

We are surrounded by Russians.  The restaurant signs are in Vietnamese,
English, and Russian.  One restaurant even had a separate Russian menu.
The dishes were totally different, few in number, and each accompanied by
a large picture.

Several of the restaurants prominently display non-decorative fish tanks.  Who
will be my next victim?
