<h1 id="europe_day_1">Europe, Day 1</h1>
<p><img src="../site/vineet_ice_small.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Vineet copes with the low coefficient of friction in Iceland.</em></p>
<p>Morning from the North,</p>
<p>Vineet and I got in just before midnight Iceland time last night. Immigration
was about five seconds in and out, and there was no customs. I bought some of
their funny money, which looks like other funny money I’ve seen. It’s not
green and it comes in large denominations.</p>
<p>Then the rental car guy put us and a few other Americans into a van and drove
five minutes to their lot, where we coughed over some more money and got into
a nice Korean SUV thing (an unexpected upgrade from what I had booked), and I
drove it on the wide, empty, Icelandic highway for less than an hour until we
reached the capital. The Airbnb place where we’re staying this and last night
is a nice, large, two bedroom apartment with a space-age shower and bizarre
power outlets. Vineet and I are in room 2. Just met the couple from room 1
this morning. They’re nice, but they talk funny. <em>I think they’re English</em>.</p>
<p>Body clock has no idea what’s going on. I guess the time difference is not so
bad. Going to drive around The Golden Circle today. I think the rental guys
might not have given us the promised full talk of “petrol,” which I presume
is a more expensive word for gasoline.</p>
<p>For those of you stalking along at home, we are currently here:</p>

<p>DNS insists on bringing me to Icelandic websites. Don’t they know who I am?</p>
